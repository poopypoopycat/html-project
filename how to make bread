<h4>5. Shape the Loaf:</h4>
<p>Punch down the risen dough to release air.</p>
<p>Shape it into a loaf and place it in a greased loaf pan.</p>
<h4>6. Second Rise (Bench Proofing):</h4>
<p>Cover the loaf with a damp cloth and let it rise again for about 30 minutes.</p>
<h4>7. Bake</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</p>
<p>Bake the bread for 25-30 minutes or until golden brown.</p>
<p>Optionally, brush the top with melted butter for a glossy finish.</p>
<h4>8. Cool and Enjoy:</h4>
<p>Let the bread cool on a wire rack before slicing and enjoying your freshly baked homemade bread!</p>
